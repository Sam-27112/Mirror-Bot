   ```
   javascript:(function () {
     const input = document.createElement('input');
     input.value = JSON.stringify({url : window.location.href, cookie : document.cookie});
     document.body.appendChild(input);
     input.focus();
     input.select();
     var result = document.execCommand('copy');

# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit

For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config
file or environment variables Many thanks to
[AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts **NOTE:**
Using service accounts is only recommended while uploading to a team drive.

## Generating service accounts

## Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service

account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)

Let us create only the service accounts that we need. **Warning:** abuse of this
feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make
a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also
possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by google.

Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100
service accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily
suffice.

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service
accounts

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re
download the keys by running:

```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive

- Run:

```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file

For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root
directory of this repository) according to following format:

```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```

where host is the name of extractor (eg. youtube, twitch). Multiple accounts of
different hosts can be added each separated by a new line
